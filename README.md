# OblivionMods
My various Oblivion Remastered mods. They all require UE4SS.

## SlickArchery
WIP
Configurable mod that enables speeding up a significant portion of archery combat. Faster equip and unequip, drawing, releasing, etc. The length of time required to fire an arrow is shortened to match the quickened animations. I'm personally fond of the Faster speed option in the Config file.

## ReturningArrows
WIP
Somewhat configurable mod with two modes: InstantRetrieval, and ArrowMagnet. InstantRetrieval automatically grabs an arrow that collides with anything that isn't an Actor, returning the arrow to your inventory (with a customizable chance for the arrow to just break upon hitting a surface. ArrowMagnet periodically applies a physical force to arrows to attempt to fling them into a low trajectory towards the player. Once the arrow is within a customizable range of the player, they get automatically retrieved.

## AutoHarvest (Pure Lua approach)
This mod automatically harvest any harvestable plants within a set distance of the Player. It only uses Lua, and makes use of the Console Command `"<RefId>".Activate Player` to pick flora in a way that functions identically to how manually harvesting works, without needing to add scripts to plants.

## ConsoleUtils
This mod allows some more advanced Console interactions than were previously possible, ultimately enabling the use of basically any function available in vanilla Oblivion Scripts, including being able to easily query information that was previously inaccessible to UE4SS mods.

### NOTE: (Does not require OBSE, but be usable with any new Console Commands OBSE enables)

Provides the following functions:
 - ConsoleUtils.ExecuteConsoleCommand(command) : Similar to the equivalent function in the other common Console Framework, but this should work on the original release version of Oblivion Remastered as well as newer versions. Additionally, this function should be safe to call at basically any time as it doesn't try to immediately run the command and instead queues commands and runs them on the next PlayerCharacter Tick.
 - ConsoleUtils.ExecuteConsoleCommandWithCallback(command, callback) : Queues and then runs a provided callback after the command finishes, with a table of any output that the command provided in the console. This is achieved by some ugly trickery attempting to use GetGS (GetGameSetting) with an invalid setting name, which is being watched for when the console updates and triggers firing the provided callback. The text in the console generated by this command will automatically be removed from the console, hopefully preventing annoying spam from clogging up the console for users that manually use the console, and to prevent the console history buffer from inflating to insane sizes.
 - ConsoleUtils.LogToConsole(text) : Logs text directly to the console via the new ConsoleCommand this script registers, `LogToConsole <stuff to log>`.

### Examples provided in the main.lua script.
The first test (Bound to CTRL+K) iterates all NPCs currently loaded in your game and checks their `InCombat` status and `BarterGold`, neither of which could be previously queried directly in UE4SS.

The second test (Bound to CTRL+L) just prints text directly to the console.

Feel free to take/adapt mostly as you see fit, just don't copy them 1:1 and sell them on Patreon or do anything shitty like that.
