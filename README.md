# OblivionMods
My various Oblivion Remastered mods. They all require UE4SS.

## SlickArchery
WIP
Configurable mod that enables speeding up a significant portion of archery combat. Faster equip and unequip, drawing, releasing, etc. The length of time required to fire an arrow is shortened to match the quickened animations. I'm personally fond of the Faster speed option in the Config file.

## ReturningArrows
WIP
Somewhat configurable mod with two modes: InstantRetrieval, and ArrowMagnet. InstantRetrieval automatically grabs an arrow that collides with anything that isn't an Actor, returning the arrow to your inventory (with a customizable chance for the arrow to just break upon hitting a surface. ArrowMagnet periodically applies a physical force to arrows to attempt to fling them into a low trajectory towards the player. Once the arrow is within a customizable range of the player, they get automatically retrieved.

Feel free to take/adapt mostly as you see fit, just don't sell it as your own or closed-source it.
